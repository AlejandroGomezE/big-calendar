## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind v3
- **Date Management**: date-fns
- **UI Components**: ⚠️ Heavily edited shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Context

Note: I **_DO NOT_** use the default shadcn components or its color palette. Some of the shadcn components have been modified to fit my design system and palette, so keep that in mind if you plan to integrate the calendar into your project.
